//Create new angular module called 'friendsList' and save that module into a variable called app
//Second parameter (an empty array) tells Angular to create a new module rather than just get an old module that has already been created
var appModule = angular.module('friendsList', []); //Initializing friendsList app; matches ng-app key on html
